Simple-Garage-Door-Controller
Simple code for garage door controller using a esp32, relay board, and home assistant

My latest simple design to make a dumb garage door smart.

This is a box to house a ESP32 on a breakout board and a relay. I am using this to house my garage door control for home assistant. See pics for the ESP32 and relay I used.

Designed in Fusion360.

I add the speaker push connectors to make hooking up to the garage door and the reed switch easier.
